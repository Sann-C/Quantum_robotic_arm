[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:200 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0072 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /home/sann/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/cmake/data/share/cmake-4.0/Modules/FetchContent.cmake:1953 (message):
  Calling FetchContent_Populate(ext_qhull) is deprecated, call
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(ext_qhull) instead.  Policy CMP0169 can be set
  to OLD to allow FetchContent_Populate(ext_qhull) to be called directly for
  now, but the ability to call it with declared details will be removed
  completely in a future version.

[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at /home/sann/ros_ws/build/Open3D/_deps/ext_pybind11-src/CMakeLists.txt:13 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
